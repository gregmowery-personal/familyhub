# New User Onboarding Flow

## Overview
The new user onboarding experience has been implemented to guide first-time users through setting up their FamilyHub account and creating their first family group.

## User Journey

### 1. Account Creation
- User signs up at `/auth` with email and password
- Form includes first name, last name, and phone (optional)
- Password strength requirements enforced

### 2. Email Verification (Prototype)
- **Development Mode**: Emails are logged to console
- Verification email sent with token link
- User clicks link to verify email address
- Welcome email sent after successful verification
- **Note**: Email service is prototype until provider is selected

### 3. Dashboard Onboarding
- New users (no families) see custom hero section
- Hero includes:
  - Welcome message with warm, supportive tone
  - 3-step getting started guide
  - Prominent "Start Here" button
  - Trust signals (secure, free, built for families)

### 4. Family Creation
- Clicking "Start Here" navigates to `/family/create`
- 3-step wizard process:
  1. **Family Details**: Name and description
  2. **Preferences**: Timezone and optional caregiver email
  3. **Review & Create**: Confirm and submit
- User becomes family coordinator upon creation
- Redirects back to dashboard with family created
