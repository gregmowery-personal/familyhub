## üöÄ Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all RBAC tests
npm run test:rbac

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/rbac/authorization-service.test.ts

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### Example Test Output
```
RBAC Authorization Service
  ‚úì should allow caregiver to access assigned recipients
  ‚úì should enforce deny overrides allow in conflict resolution
  ‚úì should handle scope-based access control
  ‚úì should complete authorization checks within 50ms (p95)

Performance Tests
  ‚úì Authorization Latency - Average: 12.3ms, P95: 28.7ms
  ‚úì Cache Performance - Hit Rate: 87.4%
  ‚úì Load Test - 2000 operations, 450 ops/sec
```
