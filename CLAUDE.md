# Claude Project Documentation

## Project Overview
FamilyHub.care - A private, shared coordination tool for families coordinating life across generations. 
**IMPORTANT**: This is NOT for storing medical information - only scheduling and reminders.

## Target Audience
- Primary users: Caregivers aged 30-60
- Often stressed and not tech-savvy
- Managing care across multiple generations
- Need simple, accessible, and warm user experience

## ðŸŽ¨ CRITICAL: UI/UX Design Standards - MUST READ FOR ALL UI WORK

### When Working on ANY UI Tasks
**YOU MUST:**
1. **Reference the Design Standards**: `/docs/DESIGN_STANDARDS.md`
2. **Follow the Implementation Guide**: `/docs/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
3. **Use the Reference Component**: `/src/components/SignupPageRedesign.tsx` as the canonical example

### Design Philosophy
- **Warm & Human**: Calming colors (sage green, lavender), supportive messaging
- **Accessible**: WCAG AA compliant, 44px touch targets, high contrast
- **Simple**: Clear language, no jargon, intuitive navigation
- **Trustworthy**: Emphasis on privacy and security

### Key UI Patterns to Follow
- Sage Green (#87A89A) & Lavender (#9B98B0) color palette
- Rounded corners (12-24px radius)
- Generous padding (p-12/p-16)
- Soft shadows, gradient backgrounds
- Large, accessible form inputs
- Two-column layouts (brand messaging + interaction)

**ALWAYS** point team members to these resources when doing UI work!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **AI**: OpenAI / Claude API (optional features)
